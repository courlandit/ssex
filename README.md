# SSEX ðŸ§ª

**SSEX** stands for **Server-Sent Events + HTML + a little chaos**.  
Itâ€™s a small, no-dependency JavaScript library that lets you plug real-time server events straight into your HTML.

Because sometimes you just want to slap an attribute on a button and make the server do stuff.  
And this? This makes it happen.

## ðŸš€ What Is This?

A tiny wrapper around `EventSource` (SSE) + a sprinkle of DOM magic.  
You write plain HTML, give elements special attributes, and SSEX handles the wiring.

No frameworks. No reactivity system. No state diffing.  
Just old-school browser power with a bit of new-school spice.
